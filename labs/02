## P02 App Design 1

1. *Find a topic where an app could improve your work or
entertain you during leisure time (an app may already exist but doesnâ€™t help or no suitable
app available)*

**App idea**: A tourist app that shows possible activities in a certain location, as in this example for the 
region of Sedrun. It can be a platform for small businesses, organisators as well as individuals to promote their
activities and bookable experiences. 

- Problem hypothesis: A tourist in Sedrun (CH) can't find information about activities easily.
- Customer hypothesis: Tourists, 20-99 years old, mainly from Switzerland
